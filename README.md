# Palmanova-Recreated-Using-Parametric-Design
Built on Rhino 7 and Grasshopper. I recreated the UNESCO protected historical city of Palmanova for my "Applied Mathematics for Parametric Architecture" course in Spring 2022 in Polimi. The parameters allow the use of different polygons, different wall and street thickness, and the ability to experiment with different bastion designs. Nothing requires manual input, the user only needs to adjust labeled number sliders.
